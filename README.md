# IPChecker
IPChecker is a Python Script that takes advantage of an SQL database to store information on IP addresses. Users can enter an IP address and a WHOIS lookup will get information on that IP address. The script keeps track of how many times that the IP Address has been entered into the script and if the IP Address has been blocked in your system.
